# Welcome to SWFL Coders Homepage
This was built on a likely rainy SW Florida Saturday with :heart: by some great people :)

## GIT & GitHub
### Rules
- Don't `push` to master only `pull` from it
- Branch names: lower-case with underscores separating words name it as close and brief to the feature you're creating like `script_folder` or simply `readme`
- Commit messages: a sentence in present-tense with punctuation that gives a decent description of what was done. Something as simple as "Adds Readme file."

### Workflow
_Remember, it's just a web page, we can fix anything. Go crazy and ship code!_

1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull`
3. `git checkout -b name_of_feature_branch`
4. Code stuff :smile:
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m "Adds cool feature and closes #2"`
7. `git push origin name_of_feature_branch`
8. Create Pull Request in GitHub and tag a teammate for code review
9. Teammate comments and/or merges your code
10. Feature branch deleted once successfully merged into GitHub master
11. Go back to step one

### Helpful Git Commands
#### Non-changing
- `git status`
- `git log`
- `git branch`
- `git branch -a`
- `git checkout -b branch_name`
- `git checkout branch_name`

#### Changing
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Cool message in present tense"`

#### Move Code Around
- `git pull`
- `git push origin branch_name`

Thank You!
